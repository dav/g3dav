To install you must have GTK+ installed and configured correctly.

Then run ./configure; make; make install

'make install' attempts to put the executable g3dav into
/usr/local/bin, so you will probably have to be root at
that point.

This has been tested only on the following systems so far:

* Linux 2.2.5 Redhat 5.2, gtk+ 1.2.1, glib 1.2.1, gcc 2.7.2.3
* Solaris 2.6, gtk+ 1.2.2, glib 1.2, gcc 2.8.1
